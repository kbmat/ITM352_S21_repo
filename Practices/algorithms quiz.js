1. set values to coins
quarters = .25
dimes = .10
nickles = .05
pennies = .01
2. enter total_number_of_coins
3. find what coin to use first based on its value
    if (total_number_of_coins >= quarters) {

    }
    else if (total_number_of_coins >= dimes && < quarters) {

    }
    else if (total_number_of_coins >= nickles && <dimes) {

    }
    else if (total_number_of_coins >= pennies && <nickles) {

    }
4. execute code (or next code) if it meets (or doesnt meet) the requirements  to divide total_number_of_coins by coin
5. multiply that number by the coin selected
6. subtract by total_number_of_coins
7. run code again until the answer is 0
