cookies vs sessions basics

cookies --> text files stored on client computer
        --> sent by the server in response to a request
        cookies only have data that the request gave the server
        cannot track user
        give cookie, anytime back 2 site, asks 4 cookie, identifies user
        already logged in, wont make relog
        can be set to expire (ex. logged in for an hour) sends a cookie
        Data stored on the CLIENT
        Keep track of login status or preferences
        data server gives to client to store
        client has access to cookies
        client can change cookies (document.cookie = "my_name=Max")
        dont store usernames and passwords in cookies
        cookies -> user logs in
sessions -> creates a file in a temporary directory on the server where registered session variables and their values are stored
        associated with unique identifier on the server
        ID on the SERVER
        Keep track of data for processing or transactions
        session id encrypted by default 
        w/o encrypted, they can just change the id (session hijacking)

        a3 persistent data -> user data
        transient data -> quantities --> session shopping cart data, login status

        express session stores data in memory 
        --> stop n start server, variables disappear
        --> sessions data disappear

        put quantity data into session
